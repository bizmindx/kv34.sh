# TODO - Major Updates Needed

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### ✅ Image Caching with Redis
- [x] Implement `ImageCache` class using Redis
- [x] Cache Docker images to avoid rebuilding
- [x] Add cache statistics and management endpoints
- [x] Integrate with `/deploy` and `/publish` endpoints

### ✅ Containerized Anvil Management
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implement containerized anvil manager
- [x] Replace host-based anvil with Docker container
- [x] Setup container-to-container communication
- [x] Use Docker network for isolated communication
- [x] Implement proper container lifecycle management
- [x] Add snapshot support for local anvil instances
- [x] Support forked anvil with real network state

### ✅ Network Management Feature
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implement network configuration system
- [x] Create `config/network.json` with local and remote networks
- [x] Implement `NetworkManager` class for network operations
- [x] Support local networks (requires anvil) and remote networks (direct RPC)
- [x] Update `/publish` endpoint to use network configuration
- [x] Add `/networks` and `/networks/{network_name}` endpoints
- [x] Update Swagger documentation with network features
- [x] Default script path: `script/Deploy.s.sol`

### 🔄 Persistent Container Storage (Next Priority)
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: Solve volume mounting limitation with `exec_run()`
- [ ] Implement persistent container manager for deployment containers
- [ ] Keep deployment containers running between deployments
- [ ] Mount project volumes dynamically
- [ ] Execute commands via `container.exec_run()` instead of `container.run()`
- [ ] Add container lifecycle management
- [ ] Implement auto-cleanup for inactive containers

**Technical Challenge**: `docker exec` doesn't support dynamic volume mounting. Need to find workaround:
- Option 1: Shared volume approach (mount large directory, copy projects)
- Option 2: Docker-in-Docker approach
- Option 3: File copying into container
- Option 4: Bind mount entire projects directory
